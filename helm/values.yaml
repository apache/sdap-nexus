  ## How to mount the granule files to ingest
  granules:

    ## mountPath is the path in the Collection Manager and Granule Ingester pods
    ## where the granule files will be mounted.
    ## IMPORTANT: the `path` property on all collections in the Collections Config file
    ## should have mountPath as the root.
    ## Example: if mountPath = /data, then every collection in the Collections
    ## Config file should have something like:
    ## path: /data/<some-directory>/<some-file-pattern>
    mountPath: /data

    ## Set nfsServer to an NFS host URL if you want to mount the granules from an NFS server.
    ## For S3 or local filesystem ingestion, leave nfsServer blank.
    nfsServer:

    ## path is the path on either local filesystem or NFS mount at which
    ## the granule files are stored. This will be ignored if S3 ingestion is enabled.
    path:

    s3:
      ## If bucket has a value, S3 ingestion will be enabled (and nfsServer will be ignored even if it has a value).
      bucket:

      ## If serviceAccountName has a value, credentials will be handled by the service account (awsCredsEnvs will be ignored
      ## even if it has a value).
      serviceAccountName: 

      ## awsCredsEnvs can include any environment variables that contain AWS credentials. Will be ignored if 
      ## serviceAccountName has a value.
      awsCredsEnvs: {}

  ## Where to find the Collections Config file
  ## ref: https://github.com/apache/incubator-sdap-ingester/tree/dev/collection_manager#the-collections-configuration-file
  ## Either localDir should be set, or the git options, but not both.
  collections:
    createCrd: false

    ## Name of a ConfigMap containing the Collections Config YAML.
    ## Leave this blank if Git is enabled below.
    configMap: collections-config

    ## Load the Collections Config file from a git repository.
    git:

      ## This should be an https repository url of the form https://github.com/username/repo.git
      url:
      branch: master
      # token: someToken

  ## Where to store ingestion history
  ## Defaults to Solr for ingestion history storage
  history:
    ## Whether to store ingestion history in a solr database instead of a filesystem directory
    solrEnabled: true

    ## storage class to use for ingestion history file only if solrEnabled = false
    storageClass: hostpath
