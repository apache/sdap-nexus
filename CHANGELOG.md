## [1.2.0] - 2023-11-22
### Added
- SDAP-467: Added pagination to cdmsresults endpoint
- SDAP-461: Added 4 remaining Saildrone insitu datasets.
- SDAP-473: Added support for matchup job prioritization
- SDAP-483: Added `.asf.yaml` to configure Jira auto-linking.
- SDAP-487: Added script to migrate existing `doms.doms_data` data to new schema.
### Changed
- SDAP-453: Updated results storage and retrieval to support output JSON from `/cdmsresults` that matches output from `/match_spark`.
  - **NOTE:** Deploying these changes to an existing SDAP deployment will require modifying the Cassandra database with stored results. There is a script to do so at `/tools/update-doms-data-schema/update.py`
  - Additional changes:
    - Made the `output` parameter case-insensitive
    - Improved speed of results insert
    - Updated `id` field of insitu points to include depth. This solves an issue with NetCDF result rendering where different insitu observations at the same place & time but at different depths were being excluded for having the same `id`.
- SDAP-455: Large job tracking
- SDAP-466: Matchup now defines secondary `platform` fields with `platform.id` if it is available and not blank. It then uses `platform.code` and `platform.type` as fallbacks, then just the value of `platform` if none work.
- SDAP-468: Updated matchup output filename
- SDAP-482: Updated Saildrone in situ endpoint in config file
- SDAP-485: Improved behavior for retrying failed Cassandra inserts when saving matchup results.
- SDAP-487: Improved result fetch speed for large matchup results by tweaking `doms.doms_data` schema to support querying by primary value id.
- Support for deploying on k8s version 1.25:
  - Upgraded Cassandra Helm chart dependency version
  - Bumped default Cassandra protocol version 3 -> 4 in webapp and tools
- SDAP-507: Changes to remove `geos` sub-dependency from core image build (partially superseded by SDAP-511 changes):
  - Removed `gdal` and `basemap` as core dependencies
  - Moved `shapely` installation in docker build from conda install to pip install
  - Disabled `/domsplot` endpoint & commented out references to its source file as it depends on `basemap` and raises `ImportError`s at startup
- SDAP-511: Switched package management to use Poetry instead of conda/mamba
### Deprecated
### Removed
- SDAP-465: Removed `climatology` directory.
- SDAP-501: Updated dependencies to remove `chardet`
### Fixed
- SDAP-474: Fixed bug in CSV attributes where secondary dataset would be rendered as comma separated characters
- SDAP-475: Bug fixes for `/timeSeriesSpark` and `/timeAvgMapSpark`
- SDAP-479: Fixed `/cdmssubset` failure for variables without specified standard_name. 
- SDAP-39: When querying for tiles by polygon, use the poly's bounding box with the bbox methods instead of using Solr's polygon search
- Status code for results endpoint if execution id is not found fixed to be `404` instead of `500`.
- Ensured links in the `/job` endpoint are https
- SDAP-488: Workaround to build issue on Apple Silicon (M1/M2). Image build installs nexusproto through PyPI instead of building from source. A build arg `BUILD_NEXUSPROTO` was defined to allow building from source if desired
- SDAP-496: Fix `solr-cloud-init` image failing to run.

## [1.1.0] - 2023-04-26
### Added

  - Also added Helm template and values to deploy this script as a `CronJob` in k8s.
### Changed
- SDAP-443:
  - Replacing DOMS terminology with CDMS terminology:
    - Renaming endpoints:
      - `/domsresults` -> `/cdmsresults`
      - `/domslist` -> `/cdmslist`
    - Removed `/domsvalues` from Swagger UI
  - Swagger UI updates:
    - `platforms` parameter in `/match_spark` is now a multi-select list.
    - Added note to `/stats` endpoint to note it is limited to satellite datasets
- SDAP-450: Updated helm chart to reflect k8s 1.22 changes. Bumped RMQ dependency version & updated Bitnami dependency chart URLs. Ingress template is already up to date.
- SDAP-451: Updated quickstart documentation
  - Specified default Docker platform as `linux/amd64`
  - Added copy button extension for RDT pages
  - Corrected volume mount paths for Solr and Cassandra containers
  - Fixed (potential) bug in RMQ monitor script
  - Updated granule download section: Replaced with a script that also accounts for dataset migration
  - Bumped image tag versions (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
- Made `platforms` param optional in `/cdmssubset`, and removed int requirement
- Updated OpenAPI specification for `/cdmssubset` to accurately reflect `platforms` and `parameter` field options.
- SDAP-436: Added special case for handling Cassandra SwathMulti tiles with uniform time arrays
- SDAP-449: Fixed `/cdmsresults` NetCDF output displaying and downloading as .txt. 
- SDAP-449: Fixed 404 error when populating datasets; script was still using `/domslist`
- SDAP-415: Fixed bug where mask was incorrectly combined across all variables for multi-variable satellite to satellite matchup
- SDAP-434: Fix for webapp Docker image build failure
- SDAP-412: Explicit definition of `__eq__` and `__hash__` in matchup `DomsPoint` class. This ensures all primary-secondary pairs with the same primary point are merged in the `combineByKey` step.
- SDAP-438: Replace variable value NaN with None to fix error in result storage
- SDAP-444: Fixed `resultSizeLimit` param in `/match_spark` truncating the results that are stored for the results endpoint.
- Fixed minor webapp image build issue
