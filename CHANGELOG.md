## [Unreleased]
### Added
- SDAP-467: Added pagination to cdmsresults endpoint
- SDAP-461: Added 4 remaining Saildrone insitu datasets.
- SDAP-473: Added support for matchup job prioritization
- SDAP-481: Added support for NetCDF compression
### Changed
- SDAP-453: Updated results storage and retrieval to support output JSON from `/cdmsresults` that matches output from `/match_spark`.
  - **NOTE:** Deploying these changes to an existing SDAP deployment will require modifying the Cassandra database with stored results. There is a script to do so at `/tools/update-doms-data-schema/update.py`
  - Additional changes:
    - Made the `output` parameter case-insensitive
    - Improved speed of results insert
    - Updated `id` field of insitu points to include depth. This solves an issue with NetCDF result rendering where different insitu observations at the same place & time but at different depths were being excluded for having the same `id`.
- SDAP-455: Large job tracking
- SDAP-466: Matchup now defines secondary `platform` fields with `platform.id` if it is available and not blank. It then uses `platform.code` and `platform.type` as fallbacks, then just the value of `platform` if none work.
- SDAP-468: Updated matchup output filename
- SDAP-482: Updated Saildrone in situ endpoint in config file
### Deprecated
### Removed
- SDAP-465: Removed `climatology` directory. 
### Fixed
- SDAP-474: Fixed bug in CSV attributes where secondary dataset would be rendered as comma separated characters
### Security

## [1.1.0] - 2023-04-26
### Added
- Deletebyquery: Parameter to set the number of rows to fetch from Solr. Speeds up time to gather tiles to delete; especially when there is a lot of them.
- Added Saildrone's `baja_2018` insitu dataset.
- SDAP-454: Added new query parameter `prioritizeDistance` to matchup algorithm
- SDAP-476: Support for service accounts for handling AWS credentials
- SDAP-459: Added explicit definitions of min/max lat/lon values in nexustiles Solr collection creation script
### Changed
- SDAP-443:
  - Replacing DOMS terminology with CDMS terminology:
    - Renaming endpoints:
      - `/domsresults` -> `/cdmsresults`
      - `/domslist` -> `/cdmslist`
    - Removed `/domsvalues` from Swagger UI
  - Swagger UI updates:
    - `platforms` parameter in `/match_spark` is now a multi-select list.
    - Added note to `/stats` endpoint to note it is limited to satellite datasets
- SDAP-450: Updated helm chart to reflect k8s 1.22 changes. Bumped RMQ dependency version & updated Bitnami dependency chart URLs. Ingress template is already up to date.
- SDAP-451: Updated quickstart documentation
  - Specified default Docker platform as `linux/amd64`
  - Added copy button extension for RDT pages
  - Corrected volume mount paths for Solr and Cassandra containers
  - Fixed (potential) bug in RMQ monitor script
  - Updated granule download section: Replaced with a script that also accounts for dataset migration
  - Bumped image tag versions (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
- Made `platforms` param optional in `/cdmssubset`, and removed int requirement
- Updated OpenAPI specification for `/cdmssubset` to accurately reflect `platforms` and `parameter` field options.
- SDAP-436: Added special case for handling Cassandra SwathMulti tiles with uniform time arrays
- SDAP-449: Fixed `/cdmsresults` NetCDF output displaying and downloading as .txt. 
- SDAP-449: Fixed 404 error when populating datasets; script was still using `/domslist`
- SDAP-415: Fixed bug where mask was incorrectly combined across all variables for multi-variable satellite to satellite matchup
- SDAP-434: Fix for webapp Docker image build failure
- SDAP-412: Explicit definition of `__eq__` and `__hash__` in matchup `DomsPoint` class. This ensures all primary-secondary pairs with the same primary point are merged in the `combineByKey` step.
- SDAP-438: Replace variable value NaN with None to fix error in result storage
- SDAP-444: Fixed `resultSizeLimit` param in `/match_spark` truncating the results that are stored for the results endpoint.
- Fixed minor webapp image build issue
